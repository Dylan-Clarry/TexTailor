# Tex Tailor
LaTex powered custom resumes

## Custom tailored resumes in minutes
This project came about by my annoyance at creating custom tailored resumes for each job posting I want to apply to. Copying and pasting different projects, swapping out action verbs, search and replacing programming terms to boost my odds against an ATS. I've decided to build this app so my custom resume build times can go from 20 minutes to 2 minutes, all whilst spending 100+ hours to build it.
